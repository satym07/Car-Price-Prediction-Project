# 🚗 Car Price Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing car resale data to understand the key factors that influence car prices in the real market. The objective is not just prediction, but to apply **data analytics techniques** to clean, explore, and interpret real-world data and extract meaningful insights.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze how different attributes impact a car’s resale value. The analysis is performed using **Python-based data analytics tools**, with a strong emphasis on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

### Dataset Includes:
- Car Model  
- Fuel Type  
- Year of Purchase  
- Ownership Type  
- Kilometers Driven

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw car resale data  
- Handling missing values and categorical variables  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify pricing trends and patterns  
- Visualization of relationships between car features and resale price  
- Extraction of insights to support better pricing decisions  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

During the analysis, the following questions were explored:

- Which car features have the strongest impact on resale price?  
- How do mileage and car age affect vehicle value?  
- Are certain fuel types or ownership patterns associated with higher prices?  

Visualizations were used to clearly communicate trends and correlations in the data.

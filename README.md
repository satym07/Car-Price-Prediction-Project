ğŸš— Car Price Prediction (First ML Project)

This is my first machine learning project where I built a model to predict used car prices based on features like brand, year, fuel type, and ownership. I used a dataset from Kaggle, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and trained a regression model using scikit-learn.

I also saved the model and encoders with joblib and built a simple web app using Streamlit so users can input car details and get a price estimate instantly.

ğŸ”§ Tools I Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Joblib
ğŸ§  What I Learned
Data preprocessing and label encoding
Model training and evaluation
Saving models and encoders
Building an interactive UI with Streamlit
ğŸš€ Run the App
""streamlit run app.py""
